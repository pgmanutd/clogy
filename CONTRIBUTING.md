# Contributing

Want to contribute? Great!

It uses Gulp + Webpack for fast developing.
Make a change in your file and instantaneously see your updates!

**If you have discovered a bug or have a feature suggestion, feel free to create an issue on Github**

## Tech

It uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
* [Gulp] - the streaming build system
* [Webpack] - a module bundler

## Installation

You need Gulp installed globally:

```sh
$ npm install gulp -g
```

## Development

Fork https://github.com/pgmanutd/clogy.git

Open your favorite Terminal and run these commands:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/{{YOUR_USERNAME}}/clogy.git
cd clogy
npm install
gulp
```

* An in memory folder (equivalent to ```dist``` folder containing clogy.js library and index.html file) will be created.
* Server will start on port ```3000``` along with webpack-hot-middleware watch. Open ```http://localhost:3000``` from your browser and play with clogy.

When you are done with your changes:
```bash
npm run build
git branch -b "YOUR_BRANCH_NAME"
git add --all
git commit -a -m "commit message"
git push -u origin "YOUR_BRANCH_NAME"
```
and create a pull request from github


##### Please follow few guidelines before raising a PR

* Write tests and make sure all are passing
* Check for lint and flow errors
* Follow the existing coding style
* Write a [good commit message](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)


## Important commands:

Show help:
```bash
$ gulp help
```

Run in Development mode (with webpack-hot-middleware watch):
```bash
$ gulp
```

Run in Development mode (without watch):
```bash
$ gulp --unwatch
```

Run in Production mode (without watch):
```bash
$ gulp --type=production
```

Run eslint on all js files:
```bash
$ gulp eslint
```

Run eslint on js file specified:
```bash
$ gulp eslint --file=src/test.js
```

Run flow check on all js files (having /* @flow */ comment at top of the file) :
```bash
$ gulp flow
```

Run unit tests, coverage using (mocha, chai, sinon and istanbul), use .only for single test:
```bash
$ gulp test
```

Any one or more, default is PhantomJS:
```bash
$ gulp test --browsers=PhantomJS,Chrome,Firefox,IE,IE9,IE10
```
